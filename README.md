After learning about HTML, CSS, JavaScript and React, I created a portfolio to put all these skills together and show off some of the projects I have made.

During this project, I learnt about [react-router](https://reactrouter.com/en/main) so I could direct the user to different pages of my website. This was also my first time using [SwiperJS](https://swiperjs.com/) to create image sliders.
