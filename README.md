After learning about HTML, CSS, JavaScript and React, I created a portfolio to put all these skills together and show off some of the projects I have made.

During this project, I learnt about [react-router](https://reactrouter.com/en/main) so I could direct the user to different pages of my website. This was also my first time using [SwiperJS](https://swiperjs.com/) to create image sliders. 

## API's
- [Swiper.js](https://swiperjs.com/)
- [Quotable](https://github.com/lukePeavey/quotable)
- [react-intersection-observer](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-intersection-observer)
